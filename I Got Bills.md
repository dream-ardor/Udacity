Directions:

Use the map() method to take the array of bill amounts shown below, and create a second array of numbers called totals that shows the bill amounts with a 15% tip added.
```javascript
var bills = [50.23, 19.12, 34.01, 100.11, 12.15, 9.90, 29.11, 12.99, 10.00, 99.22, 102.20, 100.10, 6.77, 2.22];
```
Print out the new totals array using console.log.

My Code:
```javascript
var bills = [50.23, 19.12, 34.01,
    100.11, 12.15, 9.90, 29.11, 12.99,
    10.00, 99.22, 102.20, 100.10, 6.77, 2.22
];

var totals = bills.map(function(bill) {
   bill = bill * 0.15 + bill;
   return Number(bill.toFixed(2))
});

console.log(totals)
```
