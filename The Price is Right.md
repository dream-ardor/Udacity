Directions:

Starting with this array of prices, change the prices of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th elements in the array.
```javascript
var prices = [1.23, 48.11, 90.11, 8.50, 9.99, 1.00, 1.10, 67.00];
```
My Code:

```javascript
var prices = [1.23, 48.11, 90.11, 8.50, 9.99, 1.00, 1.10, 67.00];

prices[0] = 5;
prices [2] = 6;
prices [6] = 9;

console.log(prices);

//Result: [ 5, 48.11, 6, 8.5, 9.99, 1, 9, 67 ]
